Hi, I’m **Budi Yanto**, a software developer with a unique background that bridges technology, entrepreneurship, and global experience. I'm passionate about building clean, testable, and cloud-ready applications with Spring Boot, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

I hold a **Master’s degree in Computer Science from TU Berlin**, where I developed a solid foundation in software architecture, data systems, and problem solving. After several years in Germany, I returned to Indonesia and founded a successful e-commerce business from the ground up. Through this entrepreneurial journey, I learned to combine technology with business strategy — using data to guide decisions, optimizing operations through tools like `BigSeller`, and managing international supply chains with Chinese suppliers via `1688`.

Currently, I’m fully focused on **backend development** — building modern, testable, and cloud-ready systems using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**. My main portfolio project, [**Fintrackr**](https://github.com/byanto/fintrackr), is a personal finance and investment tracking application that reflects my passion for both software and financial systems. It shows my commitment to **clean code**, **test-driven development (TDD)**, and **cloud-native design**.

Beyond coding, I’m passionate about learning, investing, farming, and sustainable living. I enjoy badminton, and I’ve been exploring **hydroponic** and **smart farming system**, combining curiosity for **IoT technology** with sustainability whenever possible.

My goal is to join an innovative team in Germany as a Backend Developer where I can continue growing and contribute long-term by integrating technical expertise, business insight, and international experience.
