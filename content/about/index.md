Hi, Iâ€™m **Budi Yanto** â€” a software engineer with a unique background that bridges technology, entrepreneurship, and global experience.

I completed my **Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at TU Berlin**, after years of studying and working in Germany. During my time there, I developed a strong foundation in software development, data systems, and problem-solving, which continues to shape how I approach every project today.

After returning to Indonesia, I built a successful e-commerce business from the ground up. Through that entrepreneurial journey, I learned to combine technology with business strategy â€” using data to guide decisions, optimizing operations through tools like `BigSeller`, and managing international supply chains with Chinese suppliers via `1688`.

Today, Iâ€™m fully focused on **backend development** â€” building modern, testable, and cloud-ready systems using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Docker**. My main portfolio project, **Fintrackr**, is a personal finance and investment tracking application that reflects my passion for both software and financial systems.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about learning, investing, and sustainable living. I enjoy badminton, and Iâ€™ve been exploring hydroponic and smart farming â€” blending technology and sustainability whenever possible.

ðŸŽ¯ **My goal**: to continue growing as a backend developer and contribute to innovative teams in Germany, combining my technical expertise, business insight, and international perspective to build meaningful software solutions.
