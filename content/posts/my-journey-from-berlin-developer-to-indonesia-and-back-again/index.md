## A New Chapter
If you look at my LinkedIn profile, you might have a few questions. A Master's in Computer Science from TU Berlin, a job as a Java developer, and then... a sudden shift in 2017 to run an e-commerce company in Indonesia for eight years. It's not exactly a straight line.

I'm writing this because I'm starting a new chapter. For a while, I've been thinking about what comes next. After building a successful business from the ground up, I've realized what I miss most is the craft of building software. So, I'm returning to my roots as a hands-on backend developer. This blog is where I plan to document that journey.

## My Foundation in Germany
My whole journey in tech really started back in Germany. I was lucky enough to study at TU Berlin for both my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science. It was an incredible education that gave me a deep technical foundation. I also had the chance to work as a developer at KNIME, a great data science company in Berlin, where I got to put my Java skills to professional use. I loved the challenge of building real software.

## An Unexpected Detour
So, what prompted the big change in 2017? Life happened. My father was diagnosed with cancer, and I felt a strong pull to move back home to Indonesia to be closer to my family. It was a difficult time, but being back also opened my eyes to a new opportunity. In 2017, e-commerce in Indonesia was just starting to explode, and with my background, I saw a chance to build something of my own.

For the next eight years, I wasn't just a developer anymore. I was the founder, the manager, the strategist, the logistics guy, ... everything. I learned how to build a team (growing to over 10 people), manage finances, and design systems (not just software systems, but business systems for inventory, shipping, and customer service). It was an incredible experience, and I'm really proud of the business I built.

## The Pull Back to Code
But over time, I found myself drawn back to the technical side of things. I was managing people and processes, but what I truly enjoyed was solving the complex, logical puzzles that come with writing code. I missed the satisfaction of building a robust feature, of designing a clean database schema, of seeing a complex system come to life. Managing a business taught me a lot about *what* to build, but I realized my passion has always been in the *how*.

## The Goal: A Modern Backend Developer
The tech world has changed a lot since I was at KNIME. So, I'm not just coming back, I'm leveling up. I'm focusing all my energy on mastering the modern backend ecosystem: Java, Spring Boot, microservices, TDD, and cloud-native practices.

To put these new skills into practice, I've started building a personal project from scratch called *"Fintrackr"*, a personal finance tracking and business application. It's my sandbox for learning and my showcase for what I can do.

## What's Next?
This is a deliberate and exciting move for me. I'm looking forward to joining a team again and focusing purely on the craft of software engineering.

In my next post, Iâ€™ll dive into the Fintrackr project, explaining the architecture and the technologies I've chosen. Thanks for reading, and I hope you'll follow along with my journey.
