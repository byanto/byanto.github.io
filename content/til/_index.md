I use this space to capture small lessons from my daily coding journey — things I’ve just learned, fixed, or finally understood. Each post focuses on a single topic, written as a quick reference for my future self and anyone learning Java, Spring Boot, or clean backend design. These short reflections help me stay consistent, document my growth, and keep improving one small insight at a time.
